I apologize for the delay in submitting. Problem 6 is still problematic, and I don't know why the data in column in get_subset_by_IQR(df,column) is not considered numerical. (maybe int64 stuff) I looked up a function on stackoverflow, and there seems to be one that uses stats instead of panda. Due to time, however, I stuck with what we have in panda.

The histogram can be improved, of course, with axis and labels, but this is for exploratory purposes. Instead of splicing using panda functions, I subsetted them. 

Question 2 with Adjusted Salary needs some improvement. I wanted to parse the last names as well, but I had trouble.
